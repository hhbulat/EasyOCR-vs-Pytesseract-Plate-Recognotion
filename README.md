# EasyOCR vs Pytesseract Plate Recognotion
Challenge at open source character recognotion libraries with plate. We have found random thirty test images. 
Firstly, we must find the car plate. Plate to find yolo predictions because yolo systems very decisive.

We found plates. Secondly find to plate contours.

Next level, predict chars. View bottom pics, succes!

Finally, we made it. We found the plate chars with pytesseract and easyocr. You shares accuracy score.(at the main.ipynb)

# I think easyocr is more successful but I think both fail!
